# GekPHP :: Lightweight PHP Framework
An open-source framework for prototyping your projects

# Another Framework? Why?
As a programmer, I've always strived to understand things at a core level. 
I've messed around with a few frameworks before, and most are bulky, and hard
to fully grasp. This framework strives to make your prototyping experience 
easier, providing easy-to-use tools built right in, only use them when you
need to.

# MVC Architecture 
This framework implements MVC to simplify the experience of adding new pages,
representing database tables, and view templating. As of right now, the views
use standard PHP templating such as <code>\<?= $variable; ?\></code>

# Plugin Support
GekPHP provides plugin support for developers seeking to build other tools outside
of the framework for use! Guide for that to come upon release of Alpha 0.1.

# In-Development 
This framework is still in heavy development. Are you interested in becoming 
a contributor? Have a look at the code. Personal business inquiries should
